I'm Zhonghao (James) Zhan, currently a Ph.D. student in computing at [Imperial College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London), supervised by [Prof. Hamed Haddadi](https://haddadi.github.io/). Before my current position, I worked as a software development engineer at Amazon's Seattle HQ from July 2021 to July 2024. I obtained my master degree in Computer Science from Cornell University and my bachelor degree in Computer Engineering from Case Western Reserve University.

My current research interests include GNN models and their applications in the IoT networks.
