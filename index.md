I'm Zhonghao (James) Zhan, currently a Ph.D. student in computing at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Hamed Haddadi](https://haddadi.github.io/). Before my current position, I worked as a software development engineer at Amazon's Seattle HQ from 2021 to 2024. I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/).

My current research interests include GNN models and their applications in the IoT networks.
